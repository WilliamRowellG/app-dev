Black Adam
:Nearly 5,000 years after he was bestowed with the almighty powers of the Egyptian gods—and imprisoned just as quickly—Black Adam (Johnson) is freed from his earthly tomb, ready to unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.
Joker
:Joker” centers around the iconic arch-nemesis and is an original, standalone story not seen before on the big screen. The exploration of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man disregarded by society, is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale.
Biyak
:Violet (Angelica Cervantes) and Samantha (Quinn Carillo) are sisters who grew up in two different worlds after Violet was given up for adoption as a kid. Though given to a wealthy family and lives a comfortable life, Violet suffers its consequences as she experiences constant sexual abuse from her adoptive father. Wanting to escape this misery, she searches for her real family with the help of her boyfriend, William (Vance Larena). From a fruitful search, she is able to reconnect with her biological mother, and meets her half-sister, Samantha, a tough girl who grew up in the slums and a former drug courier, but is now a police asset and helps police officers like Erwin (Albie Casiño) solve drug-related cases. Though each grew up with two different lifestyles, the two sisters will find their unusual common ground as both of their worlds revolve around drugs and sexual abuse. Now that they've got each other's back and have the real ones who truly love them, will these two suffering souls finally have a peaceful life and the loving family they deserve?
